Hello! My name is Joemari Javier Pulido from the beautiful island of Saipan in the Northern Marianas Islands. Broadly, my academic interests include Psychology, Neuroscience, Computer Science, and Evolution. Specifically, my interests are in Computational Neuroscience, Cognition, Sensation and Perception, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Bayesian Statistics, and Neuroimaging.

The Computational Theory of Mind posits that the brain is a computer and that cognition is computation. If cognition is computation, then this means that there is a computational model that could be created to model cognitive processes. This is what I am interested in! I am interested in creating computational models of cognition. Why? In Mathematics, when we have a formula for a function we are able to predict an output given an input. Therefore, with a computational model of cogntion we may be able to predict human behavior in respect to a cognitive process given the inputs that they have acquired from their environment through their senses. 

Outside of academics, I enjoy going dancing with friends, going to the beach and swimming, binge watching shows such as Supernatural and Game of Thrones, and trying new foods!
