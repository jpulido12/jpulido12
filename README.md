Hello, my name is Joemari Javier Pulido! I was born and raised in the beautiful island of [Saipan](https://www.britannica.com/place/Saipan) in the [Northern Marianas Islands](https://www.britannica.com/place/Northern-Mariana-Islands). Broadly, my academic interests are in Computational Neuroscience/Psychology, Cognition, Sensation and Perception. My specific interests are in utilizing neuroimaging, machine learning, neural nets, and artificial intelligence to create computational models of cognitive mechanisms, such as language acquisition, and test these models. Currently, I'm an undergraduate student at Providence College, Research Assistant, Lab Manager, and Peer Tutor. 

Outside of academics, I enjoy going dancing with friends, going to the beach and swimming, binge watching shows such as [Supernatural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural_(American_TV_series)) and [Game of Thrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones), and trying new foods! Some of my favorite foods include [kare kare](https://panlasangpinoy.com/kare-kare-recipe/), [lamb vindaloo](https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/lamb-vindaloo/), and [seafood boil](https://rasamalaysia.com/seafood-boil/). My favorite sweets are [boba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_tea), [kakanin](https://www.angsarap.net/2019/09/09/the-endless-varieties-of-kakanin/), and anything [matcha](https://www.teatulia.com/tea-varieties-101/what-is-matcha.html).
