Hello! My name is Joemari Javier Pulido born and raised in the beautiful island of Saipan in the Northern Marianas Islands. Broadly, my academic interests are in Computational Neuroscience/Psycholgoy, Cognition, Sensation and Perception. My specific interests are in utilizing neuroimaging, machine learning, neural nets, and artificial intelligence to create computational models of cognitive mechanisms such as language acquisition.

Outside of academics, I enjoy going dancing with friends, going to the beach and swimming, binge watching shows such as Supernatural and Game of Thrones, and trying new foods! Some of my favorite foods include fried chicken, kare kare, lamb vindaloo, and boba.
