Hello, my name is Joemari Javier Pulido from the beautiful island of Saipan in the Northern Marianas Islands. Broadly, my academic interests include Psychology, Neuroscience, Computer Science and Evolution. 

The Computational Theory of Mind posits that the brain is a computer. Based on this idea, I am interested in "dissecting" the brain computationally in order to understand the underlying mechanisms during cognitive processes. Further, I want to create computational models of cognition. 

For fun, I like going dancing with friends, watching series like Game of Thrones, and trying different foods.
