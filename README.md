Hello! My name is Joemari Javier Pulido from the beautiful island of Saipan in the Northern Marianas Islands. Broadly, my academic interests are in Computational Neuroscience/Psychology, Cognition, Sensation and Perception. My specific interests are in Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Neural Nets, Bayesian Statistics, and Neuroimaging.

The Computational Theory of Mind posits that the brain is a computer and that cognition is computation. This suggests that we can create computational models of cognition. This is what I'm interested in doing! Specifically, I want to create a computational models of human cognition. Further, I wish to develop algorithms that will enable machines and robots to comprehend and communicate human language. 

Outside of academics, I enjoy going dancing with friends, going to the beach and swimming, binge watching shows such as Supernatural and Game of Thrones, and trying new foods!
